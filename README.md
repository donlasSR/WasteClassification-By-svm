## 🚀 Features

- Uses SVM for image classification
- Works on flattened image data (e.g. grayscale 28x28 → 784 features)
- Simple and efficient for small to medium datasets
- Includes training, evaluation, and prediction steps

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run each cell to load data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

📊 Dataset
You can use datasets like:

MNIST

CIFAR-10 (after flattening images)

Any image dataset converted to numerical feature vectors
